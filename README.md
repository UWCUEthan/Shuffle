# Shuffle
Create a program that will simulate a standard deck of playing cards.  Cards have values of numerals 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.  Ace is equal to 1. The cards have the four standard suits of Hearts, Spades, Clubs, and Diamonds.

A deck interface is provided with three functions that need to be implemented; Display, Shuffle, and Draw.  

Display needs to return a List<string> of all of the cards in the deck in the format of “Ace of Spades”, ”Two of Clubs”, ”Jack of Hearts”, etc.
  
Shuffle needs to randomize the order of all the cards in the deck.
  
Draw needs to return the top card from the deck as well as removing it from the contents of the deck.
